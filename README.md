# doc-overflow
Provides source documents for all languages and topics on Stack Overflow post

I wanted an easy way to link to source documentation about the relevant languages mentioned in a Stack Overflow post.  Furthermore, the main key words on the question page are parsed and the google search link to those topics are made available.   Last, any links provided in the best answer are also listed in the sidebar.
